    <p>Ada Thorne (née Shelby) is the fourth and only female of the Shelby siblings and the only sibling initially not involved with the Peaky Blinders. By the end of 1924, however, Ada assumes a leading position at the United States branch of Shelby Company Limited, dealing only with legal acquisitions; unlike her brothers back home in Birmingham, England.
        She is the widow of known communist, Freddie Thorne, with who she has son, Karl Thorne — named after Karl Marx.</p>
